## Trivia and small talks
Hello or Hello again, this is L.M. Thank you for viewing this repository.
This is my Software Engineering course project, and my second game project. How about the first one? Well, I have abandoned it for about 1 year for many reasons. The incentive factor is the leave of art design, but for now i don't feel like blaming others. Mainly because I myself lack motivation. But now hey, this is course project. I will fail the course if I give up, so I force myself to have no choice. I really don't want to give up once again.

Anyway, we hope you can give us a helping hand on this project, whether you are led here or just passer-by.

## Last Update
* Walking, Jumping Animation (UnityChan Sprite material will not be used in the final version)
